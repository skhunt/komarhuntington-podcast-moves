# "Homecoming" Analysis


## Organization

"Homecoming" is a fictional podcast produced by Gimlet Media, and stars multiple well-known actors including Catherine Keener and David Schwimmer. The story is presented as a psychological thriller that is focused on the first-hand experiences of one character, Heidi Bergman, told through various conversations, both recorded and occurring in real-time, at different points in the story's timeline. Although Heidi is present during every scene, her own perspective and perceived reality is oftentimes unclear, as most of the  conversations involve her primarily listening to another character, rather than doing most of the talking herself. In addition, the scenes occur out of order, jumping forward and backward in time at key moments to help fill in important details and flesh out the overall context of the story. This type of storytelling has a chilling effect on the listener, intriguing the audience and causing them to listen more closely in the hopes of learning more about Heidi and what has happened to her.

## Style

To help fully immerse the audience in the world being presented, the producers of "Homecoming" made concerted efforts to include as much descriptive detail as they could through the use of sound and effects. This was accomplished by including both realistic sounds to anchor the listener in the established reality of the story, as well as unique sound effects to help ignite the imagination of the listener to facilitate their experience with the story. One prime example of a surreal kind of sound effect is a subtle, yet distinct \**swoosh** sound that accompanies every scene change and also corresponds with a flash forward or backward in time. Some further examples of the types of realistic sound effects predominant throughout the story include:

* Bubbles/running water (from an aquarium)
* Phone static
* Telephone ringing
* Driving on asphalt
* Writing on paper
* Talking in the background (from non-characters)
* Restaurant sounds (bell chimes, clattering dishes, etc.)
* Airport announcements in the background
* Singing from a tropical bird

These kinds of sounds provide a breadth of detail for the audience, establishing the scene without any visuals whatsoever, while also helping develop a very effective tone of supposed normalcy with an unmistakable tinge of foreboding and uncertainty.

## Narrative Types

Much of this story is told through Heidi's experiences at a given moment in time, so the narrative is primarily portrayed through a conversational lens. Scenes occur either in-person or over the phone, and are placed contextually within the events of the story, with Heidi talking to one other character at a time. In-person conversations between Heidi and others occur in various contexts including:

* Therapy appointments
* Busy diner
* City alleyway
* Unknowingly recorded interactions
* Retirement home

Aside from these in-person conversations, Heidi's interactions occur exclusively over the phone, both in the past and the future settings of the story. In addition, many of these conversations are interview-based, such as with Heidi interviewing her client Walter, or with Thomas interviewing Heidi about her old job. These kinds of conversations significantly add to the themes of paranoia and memory loss that are prevalent throughout the story, as neither the audience nor the characters can be sure about the answers they are giving, or being given in return.
